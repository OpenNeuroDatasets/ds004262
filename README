# Continuous Feedback Processing

Twenty-one participants learned to predict the final level of an animated rising bar. Following the appearance of a fixation cross, participants used the mouse to indicate their guess (i.e., how high they thought the bar would rise). After a delay, participants watched the bar rise to its final level. Points were awarded based on the distance between their guess and the actual level. Each round was cued by the appearance of a gnome (cover story: the gnomes are playing a strongman game while visiting a fair). Cues vary in the degree to which the outcome is predictable (highly predictable, somewhat predictable, unpredictable).  

Timing  
fixation cross (400-600 ms) -> gnome cue (1500 ms) -> bar outline (until response) -> animation (1 degree per second until complete) -> final outcome (1000 ms)

Conditions (Gnome Types)  
1: consistently low  
2: consistently high  
3: low or high with equal probability  
4: usually (80%) low, sometimes high  
5: usually (80%) high, sometimes low  
6: random uniform distribution  

Trigger Modifiers  
Add 0: Fixation cross  
Add 10: Cue (gnome) onset  
Add 20: Bar outline appears  
Add 30: Participant response  
Add 40: Start of animation  
Add 50: End of animation (and start of 1-second delay)
